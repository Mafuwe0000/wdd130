                TERMS & Conditions
                For convenience, PassionAir offers online check-in to its passengers.

                To check online log unto www.flypassionair.com and use the online check-in option. You’ll be required to provide your Booking Reference, first name, and surname and accept the terms and conditions to proceed.
                Once this is done, passengers must print their boarding pass online and proceed to the airport.
                Online check-in is available on all PassionAir’s flights from 24hours up to 3 hours before the scheduled departure time.
                Passengers are required to produce a valid national photo ID at the screening point and at the boarding gate. Acceptable IDs are Passport, National ID Card, Non-resident ID card, Driver’s License and National Health Insurance Card. Any passenger without identification will be refused travel.
                Passengers with checked bags must drop them off at the designated bag drop counter prior to counter closure.
                The Check-in counter closes 40min before departure and once the counter is closed, no bags can be accepted for travel.
                Once bags have been dropped off, passengers can go to the screening point at the boarding gate. Passengers without a checked bag may proceed to the security screening point.
                Passengers must ensure that their hand luggage meets PassionAir’s weight and size requirements as described below:
                One bag of 7Kg maximum with dimensions of 55cmX35cmX23cm wheels and handle included for Bronze and Silver fare passengers + one handbag or laptop bag.

                If hand luggage is overweight or oversized, passengers will be sent back to the check-in or the luggage may be taken by our representatives at the boarding or at the ramp and checked in under a limited release tag.
                Passengers must ensure they have gone through security screening and are present at the boarding gate at least 40 minutes before the scheduled departure time. The boarding gate closes 25 minutes before departure and passengers who are not present at the gate by that time will be offloaded.
