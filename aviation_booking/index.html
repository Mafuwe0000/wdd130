                <h2> What is Booking?
                    A booking is an arrangement to reserve a certain ticket, accommodation or a place in advance.
                    Prices can be frozen by booking to pay a more affordable price for travel scheduled in the future. Reservation rules are explained in detail on Reservations.
                    It's ridiculously easy. You don't have to be an expert to make a booking online. All you need is an internet connection and a credit card!
                    Passengers need to choose a return or a one-way ticket, their destinations, scheduled dates and number of people to fly to book their flight. 
                    After choosing the suitable flight listed on the page, passengers need to choose among the flight packages (Basic, Essentials, Advantage, Business Flex). After that, passengers may proceed with additional services.
                    For flights in great demand, time for booking is limited. Freezing the prices for these flights enables passengers to be notified when the time comes to purchase the tickets later.  </h2>
